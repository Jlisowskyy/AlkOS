AlkOS is an open-source operating system project targeting the x86_64 architecture. This project serves as an engineering thesis, focusing on the development of a functional operating system kernel. The immediate goal is to implement a preemptive multitasking scheduler. Future plans include developing a shell and support for user-mode programs.

**Current Features:**

*   **Boots to a 64-bit kernel:** The system successfully loads and executes a 64-bit kernel.
*   **Basic memory management:**  Includes setting up page tables for identity mapping the first 1 GiB of memory using 2 MiB pages in the boot process.
*   **Serial port debugging output:**  Supports sending debug messages to a serial port, which is captured by QEMU and can be redirected to the standard output or a file.
*   **Custom testing framework:** Similar to Google Test, allowing for easy definition and execution of test cases within the kernel environment. Tests can be filtered and managed using command-line arguments. The framework supports test assertions (e.g., `ASSERT`, `R_ASSERT_EQ`) and automatic test discovery.
*   **Support for floating-point operations:** The kernel correctly sets up the x87 FPU and AVX extensions, allowing for floating-point calculations.
*   **Interrupt handling:** The kernel includes an Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) and can handle basic interrupts. Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) is configured to handle hardware interrupts.
*   **Support for GCC C++ Standard Library features:** Includes features like new/delete operators and static initializers.
*   **Stack Smashing Protection:** The kernel utilizes the `-fstack-protector-all` flag during compilation and has a basic implementation of stack canaries to detect stack buffer overflows.
*   **VGA driver:** Supports basic text output to the screen using the VGA text mode.
*   **C Standard Library:** A partial implementation of the C standard library is provided, including functions like `snprintf`, `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcmp`, `memcpy`, `memset`, etc.
*   **Input from serial port:** The kernel can read input from the serial port, enabling basic interaction via a terminal emulator.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of AlkOS are:

1.  **Implement a preemptive multitasking scheduler:** This is the current focus and a critical step towards a functional operating system.
2.  **Develop a shell:** A basic shell will allow user interaction with the system.
3.  **Support user-mode programs:** This will enable the execution of user applications.
4.  **Serve as an engineering thesis:** AlkOS is being developed as part of an academic project to demonstrate OS development principles.

## 🛠️ Key Scripts

*   `scripts/alkos_cli.bash` - Main CLI script that orchestrates the project. It can install dependencies, build the project, run it in QEMU, and more.
*   `scripts/actions/prepare_env.bash` - Installs the development environment, including dependencies and the cross-compilation toolchain.
*   `scripts/install/build_alkos.bash` - Builds the AlkOS kernel and creates an ISO image.
*   `scripts/install/run_alkos.bash` - Runs AlkOS in QEMU.
*   `scripts/install/make_iso.bash`- Creates an ISO image from the built kernel and modules.
*   `scripts/actions/attach_to_qemu_gdb.bash` - Attaches GDB to a running QEMU instance for debugging the kernel.
*   `scripts/actions/apply_clang_format.bash`- Applies clang-format to the source code to maintain consistent code style.
*   `scripts/tests/test_framework/main.py` - Entry point for the test framework.

## Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

*   A system running **Arch Linux** (for installing dependencies and running the scripts).
*   **CMake** >= 3.30: Used as the build system.
*   **QEMU:** Used for emulating the x86_64 architecture and running AlkOS.
*   **NASM:** Used as the assembler for assembly code.
*   **grub-mkrescue:** Used for creating bootable ISO images.
*   **wget:** Used by the installation scripts for downloading necessary source files.
*   A cross-compilation toolchain for x86_64-elf (installed by `alkos_cli.bash`).
*   An AUR helper like `paru` or `yay` (if you want to use one).
*   **make**: Used for building the project.
*   **ld** (the GNU linker): Used for linking the project.

### 🛠️ Installation: Dependencies and Toolchain

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Jlisowskyy/AlkOS](https://github.com/Jlisowskyy/AlkOS)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the scripts directory:**

    ```bash
    cd AlkOS/scripts
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies and the cross-compilation toolchain:**

    ```bash
    ./alkos_cli.bash --install all --verbose
    ```
    or:
    ```bash
    ./alkos_cli.bash -i all -v
    ```

    This step will install all necessary dependencies, set up the toolchain, and configure your environment.
    Note: it assumes you are running on Arch Linux. If not, you will need to manually install the packages listed in `scripts/env/arch_packages.txt` and install a cross-compiler for `x86_64-elf` and `i386-elf`.

## 💻 Development Workflow

### 🏗️ Building AlkOS

1.  **Navigate to the scripts directory:**

    ```bash
    cd AlkOS/scripts
    ```

2.  **Build the project:**
    The build system uses CMake. When you run `alkos_cli.bash` with `-r`, it first invokes the `build_alkos.bash` script. This script creates a build directory, generates Makefiles using CMake with the specified cross-compilation toolchain, and then builds the project using `make`.

    ```bash
    ./alkos_cli.bash --verbose --run
    ```
    
    or:
    
    ```bash
    ./alkos_cli.bash -v -r
    ```

### ️️️Running AlkOS in QEMU

   The `-r` flag of `alkos_cli.bash` also handles running AlkOS in QEMU after building it. It invokes `run_alkos.bash` script. This script will start QEMU with the correct parameters, including booting from the generated ISO image.

   ```bash
   ./alkos_cli.bash -v -r
   ```
    
### 🧪 Running Tests

   AlkOS includes a custom testing framework inspired by Google Test. Tests are defined within the kernel code and are executed in the QEMU environment.

1.  **Navigate to the scripts directory:**

    ```bash
    cd AlkOS/scripts
    ```

2.  **Run the test framework:**

    ```bash
    ./tests/test_framework/main.py --path ./install/run_alkos.bash --filter "*"
    ```

    The build process must have been run at least once before running the tests.
    You can change the `--filter` argument to run specific tests, for example: `--filter "StackSmash*"`.
    Use `--block` to exclude tests, for example: `--block "StackSmash*"`.
    Use `--display` to display all tests that will be run according to flags specified without running them.

### 🐛 Debugging with GDB

1.  **Build the project in debug mode (default).**
2.  **Run AlkOS in QEMU with GDB debugging enabled:**

    ```bash
    ./install/run_alkos.bash -v -r -g <path_to_iso>
    ```

    Replace `<path_to_iso>` with the actual path to your AlkOS ISO image (e.g., `../build/bin/alkos.iso`).
3.  **In a separate terminal, attach GDB to the running QEMU instance:**

    ```bash
    ./actions/attach_to_qemu_gdb.bash <path_to_kernel_binary> -g <path_to_gdb>
    ```

    Replace `<path_to_kernel_binary>` with the path to your compiled kernel binary (e.g. `../build/sysroot/boot/alkos.kernel`).
    Replace `<path_to_gdb>` with the path to your GDB executable, if it's not the default one provided by the cross-compiler.

### 🎨 Applying clang-format for Code Style

1.  **Navigate to the scripts directory:**

    ```bash
    cd AlkOS/scripts
    ```

2.  **Run the clang-format script:**

    ```bash
    ./actions/apply_clang_format.bash
    ```

    This will format all C++ and C source files according to the project's style defined in `.clang-format` file.
