/**
 * @brief This file's purpose is to define a set of macros used as placeholders
 * for tasks that need to be addressed before specific project milestones.
 * These macros serve as markers for areas requiring further development,
 * testing, or refactoring. All macros defined here are temporary and should
 * be removed upon completion of the tasks they represent.
 *
 * Note: Removing such a macro will result in compilation errors in the areas
 * marked by the macro, ensuring that all associated tasks are resolved
 * before the codebase progresses to the next milestone.
